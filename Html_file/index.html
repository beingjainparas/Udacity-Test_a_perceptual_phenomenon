            <p class="lead">In a Stroop task, participants are presented with a list of words, with each word displayed in a color of ink. The participant’s task is to say out loud the color of the ink in which the word is printed. The task has two conditions: a congruent words condition, and an incongruent words condition. In the congruent words condition, the words being displayed are color words whose names match the colors in which they are printed: for example <span class="text-danger">RED</span>, <span class="text-primary">BLUE</span>. In the incongruent words condition, the words displayed are color words whose names do not match the colors in which they are printed: for example <span class="text-success">PURPLE</span>, <span class="text-warning">ORANGE</span>. In each case, we measure the time it takes to name the ink colors in equally-sized lists. Each participant will go through and record a time from each condition.</p>

                                In the concurrent histogram, more number of subjects lies in the range of 9-17 seconds time range, whereas in the inconcurrent histogram, more number of subjects lies in the range of 20-25 seconds time range.

                                Both of this histograms are more or less normally distributed.

                        Conclusion on observation of the statistics:
                    </dt>
                    <dd>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                So the t-Statistic value(-8.020706944) is less then our t-Critical value(-2.069) for a one tail test with confidence level of 95%, So we can reject our null hypothesis.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                So I can now conclude that the results match with our expectations that it takes less time to do the congruent task than it does to do the incongruent task.
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                <h3><li>Optional: What do you think is responsible for the effects observed? Can you think of an alternative or similar task that would result in a similar effect?</li></h3>
                <p>I think the human brain is responsible for the effects observed.</p>
                <p>I can think of a coloured number test.</p>
