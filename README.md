# Project Overview: Overview
In this project, I investigated a classic phenomenon from experimental psychology called the [Stroop Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroop_effect). I learned a little bit about the experiment, created a hypothesis regarding the outcome of the task, also gone through the task myself. I then look at some data collected from others who have performed the same task and also computed some statistics describing the results. Finally, I interpreted my results in terms of my hypotheses.

## Why this Project?
Statistics is a major component of data analysis, it allows you to investigate data and make inferences based on your observations. A foundation in statistics also allows you to be a consumer of analyses that others perform, and allows you to relate to the conclusions others have drawn from their investigations.

## What did I Learn?
This project helped me learn the basic concepts of statistics, including:
* How to identify components of an experiment
* How to use descriptive statistics to describe qualities of a sample
* How to set up a hypothesis test, make inferences from a sample, and draw conclusions based on the results


## Why is this Important to my Career?
This project is focused on statistics, including designing an experiment and testing a hypothesis. Using statistics to draw valid conclusions about data is an important part of a data analyst's work. When you see a company release a new feature, what do you think went into the decision making? Typically, a business has a goal they want to achieve - for any educational institute, it may mean increased enrollments. They spend a long time user testing and A/B testing to make sure trials of potential products indicate they would get the outcome they wanted.

# Project Details: How did I Complete this Project?
Followed [these instructions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-OkpZLjG_kX9J6LIQ5IltsqMzVWjh36QpnP2RYpVdPU/pub?embedded=True) and created a pdf/html document answering the questions. These document formats are compatible across a broad range of computers and browsers and are one of the surest ways of making sure that my intents are received properly.
